# flashcards-project

### Overview
- In this project I used TDD to drive implementation of code for a set of flash cards to be used in game. I focused on writing reusable code that follows SRP and has consistent use of ES6 techniques learned to date.

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Mocha
- Chai

### Install Instructions
- For this project, you need to use this Flashcards Starter repo. 
- Follow the instructions in the README for forking the repo and getting it setup. 
- Once you have it set up (through running npm install), follow the instructions to verify it is setup correctly.
- Please note that there is logic provided to you (util.js) to make this game playable via the command line. 
- Completion of Iterations I and II are required before you are able to utilize the command line interface
- Use CLI to verify that your code is functioning properly. 
- Prior to this, you should be using your tests to confirm functionality is working as you expect.

### Setup Instructions
- Npm install
- Clome the repo to your local machine
- cd into it
